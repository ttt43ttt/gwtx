    This package is a copy of the Bean Validation API   classes from the Agimatec Validation Project.
    http://agimatec-validation.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/java/javax/validation
</p>
<p>
    Changes made for GWT compatibility :
    <ul>
    <li>
    The <tt>PatternValidator</tt> class has been modified to use native JavaScript regular expression in replacement
    for unsupported <tt>java.util.regexp</tt> package.
    </li>
    <li>The <tt>ValidationProviderFactory</tt> class has been modified to remove ValidationProvider discovery, that
    is not available on GWT : The GWT application is reponsible to select a GWT compatible ValidationProvider library
    and to set it as ValidationProvider during application startup.
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Please note the <tt>@Pattern</tt> annotation support is limited to compatibility between Java and JavaScript
    regular expression, as explained
    <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.html#JavaRuntimeSupport">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can import the javax.validation emulated classes by adding the following import to your .gwt.xml file:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>
        &lt;inherits name="gwtx.javax.Persistence"/&gt;
    </code>
</blockquote>
